<h3>A small program in Java to check if a sentence or a word is a palindrome or not.</h3>

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward.

<strong>It also works with French language.</strong>

<h4>Example:</h4>

System.out.println(isAPalindrome("racecar") + " -> racecar");

<h4>Output:</h4>

true -> racecar
